///
/// # Architecture
///
/// The engine functions as a state machine:
/// - **Input**:
///     - Bytes received from the network (`handle_incoming`).
///     - Time ticks for keep-alive/timeouts (`handle_tick`).
///     - High-level commands like `publish`, `subscribe` calls.
/// - **Output**:
///     - Bytes to be sent to the network (accessible via `take_outgoing`).
///     - Events (state changes, incoming messages) for the application (`take_events`).
///
/// # Usage
///
/// 1. Initialize with `MqttClientOptions`.
/// 2. Connect the underlying transport (TCP/TLS/QUIC/etc.).
/// 3. Call `connect()` to initiate the MQTT handshake.
/// 4. In a loop:
///     - Feed incoming bytes: `engine.handle_incoming(&buf)`.
///     - Check for outgoing bytes: `engine.take_outgoing()`.
///     - Handle events: `engine.take_events()`.
///     - Manage time: Call `engine.handle_tick(now)` and sleep until `engine.next_tick_at()`.
///
/// # Buffer Limits
///
/// The engine enforces strict buffer limits to prevent memory exhaustion:
/// - `outgoing_buffer`: Limits queued packets waiting to be sent. Returns `MqttClientError::BufferFull` if exceeded.
/// - `events`: Limits pending events. Pauses parsing (back-pressure) if limit reached.
